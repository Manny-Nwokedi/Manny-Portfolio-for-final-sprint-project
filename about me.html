        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>
        <p>I am a seasoned professional based in the picturesque locale of St. John's, NL. With a rich professional background spanning the military, financial, and government services sectors, I bring a wealth of experience in the realm of customer success.
        My professional journey has equipped me with a robust skill set tailored for success in dynamic and multifaceted environments. Having navigated the intricacies of customer success and experience in both the service and sales industry, I have developed a strategic approach to driving excellence and fostering enduring relationships at all levels.

Presently, I'm venturing into new horizons, excited to channel my inherent drive and commitment to professional growth into the dynamic realms of software development and tech sales. Currently enrolled in a software development program at Keyin College, I am immersing myself in the skills and knowledge needed for this exciting career transition.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I play an active role in various community activities while serving as a reservist in the Canadian Armed Forces. Currently holding the position of Platoon Commander for 36 CSS under the 37 Service Battalion, I am dedicated to both professional and community service.</p>
